# Water Quality Prediction

Water quality refers to the chemical, physical, and biological characteristics of water based on the standards of its usage. The most common standards used to monitor and assess water quality convey the health of ecosystems, safety of human contact, and condition of drinking water. Water quality has a significant impact on water supply and oftentimes determines supply options.

Here we want to predict the quality of water( whether it is safe to drink or not = water **Potability** = 0 or 1) based on 9 features: **pH**, **Hardness**, **TDS**, **Chloramines**, **Sulfate**, **Conductivity**, **TOC**, **THMs**, and **Turbidity**.

For more detailed description of the project and each feature, look at the jupyter notebook file (water-quality.ipynb)
