# Water Quality Prediction

Water quality refers to the chemical, physical, and biological characteristics of water based on the standards of its usage. The most common standards used to monitor and assess water quality convey the health of ecosystems, safety of human contact, and condition of drinking water. Water quality has a significant impact on water supply and oftentimes determines supply options.

Now based on these 9 features we will find whether the water is safe to drink or no (water **Potability** = 0 or 1).
