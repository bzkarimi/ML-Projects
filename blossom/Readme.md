# Blossoming Date Prediction

In this exercise, we build a model to predict the status of cherry blossoms (before bloom, bloom, full, scatter) at Hirosaki Park in Hirosaki City, Aomori Prefecture, Japan using a Nueral Network by analyzing the temperature data and previous flowering information (from 1997 - 2019).
