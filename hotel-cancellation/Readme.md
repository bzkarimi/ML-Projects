# Hote Cancellation Prediction

In this exercise, we will build a model to predict hotel cancellations with a binary classifier. We use a Neural Network with 2 hidden layers, Adam optimizer and binary versions of the cross-entropy loss and accuracy metric. The model will have both batch normalization and dropout layers.
